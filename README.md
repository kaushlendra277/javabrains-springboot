####What is SpringBoot ?<br />
####Ans - Spring App + Bootstap = SpringBoot , <br />
SpringBoot is a tool which creates a production ready spring application <br />
that we can "JUST RUN"[WITHOUT SETTING UP ANY TRADITIONAL XML BASED CONFIG. AND JAR ADDING STEP]



#### Note : 
<br>
If we want use our own configurtion we can change default using application.properties file
<br>
Spring boot at the time of bootsrap reads  application.properties file to configure the app

<br>

To know the key of application.properties file  which is required to change or configure
<br>
refer, "Common Application properties" in Spring boot docs
